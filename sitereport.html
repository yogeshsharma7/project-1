		 	<h1>Experience</h1>
		 	<p>My name is Yogesh Sharma student of Naya Aaayam multi-disciplinary Institute. Recently, I have joined this college and pursuing my degree of Computing under the University of Northampton. As you see my previous education computer science is my major subject. Due to spending a lot of time in computer I'm so much interested in computung field. Then, I started my first year in march 1st 2021. From the starting day I have enjoyed a lot in the college. The environment of college is so peace and beautiful. There are six modules in our course but we have to study three modules. The modules name is Web Development, Database, Computer System. Among them Web Development is the most interested subject for me. Web development mainly focus on coding which makes for interest for me. From the first lecture we started doing HTMl in web development. The lecture hours are so good. Teachers are so good and puntual with all the students which makes us more easier to talk to them. In a week I have one lecture class of one hour and tutorial class of two hour. Doing Web classes in the Lab with friends makes class more interesting. After some months of our web classes I got a assignment of web development. At first I was in delima what to do in assignment but then I talked to my module teacher. He helped me how to start my assignment. In my assignment at first I have made a homepage where my profile picture is presented and about me. In the second place there is portfolio where my works are presented. In third i have made a contact form where public can contact me and fill their contacts as how can I reach them. In fourth I made a CV where about me is presented. In fifth page I Have made a site report where what I did in the whole portfolio page is mentioned briefly. In some places I faced a problem while doing padding and margin but then I did a inspect which helped me to correct the page in good way. At first,  Mobile responsive is also a different thing for me but while doing a work slowly I  made a page responsive too which made this page soo much interesting and beautiful for mobile viewers.</p>
        <h1>Module Experience</h1>
        <p>Web development is one of the interesting subject in our module code CSY1018. It helps in developing the website in various ways. At first I learned about how to make a webpage and how to make it attractive. After few weeks of lecture and tutorial I got much interest in Web development. In starting it makes so difficult to understand everything but our module teacher helped me more which makes easier to do assignment.</p>

        <img src="zz.png"> 
        <p>While making the portfolio page at first in the home page I used the background image of computer as white but it do not suits on it and I've changed it to the light green colour. Previously my profile picture's height and width was larger but now I have reduced the height and width of the picture. In the header section the hover effect in nav has been applied and color of nav items have been changed from black to red.</p>
        <h3>Portfolio</h3>
